## Announcement

* HW7 (Q1-7) due today @ 11:59pm on Gradescope/BruinLearn.

* Please send me any topics and questions you would like me to review by Wed Dec 4 @ 5pm.

* Concluding remarks. Three pillars of machine learning: analysis/probability/statistics, linear algebra/optimization, and computing/algorithms. Stephen Boyd's [advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U41e7hKAAPQ&t=4560s) on graduate studies.

* Course evaluation: [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/).

## Feedback on HW6 (thanks to Tomoki)

* Q2. Some students immediately claimed $N(A)=N(A')$  without using the fact that $A$ is normal.

* Q3.2. Half of the students showed incomplete solutions without using backward/forward substitution or the induction method.

* Q3.5. $A$ has to be both upper and lower triangular due to part (ii) and orthogonality, meaning $A$ must be diagonal.

* Q10.3. Use the fact that eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.

## Today

* SVD (cont'd).

* MV calculus and optimization.
