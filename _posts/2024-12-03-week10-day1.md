## Announcement

* Course evaluation: [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/).

* HW7 due Tue Dec 3 @ 11:59pm on Gradescope/BruinLearn.

* Please send me any topics and questions you would like me to review for the final exam.

## Feedback on HW6 (thanks to Tomoki)

* Q2. Some students immediately claimed $N(A)=N(A')$  without using the fact that $A$ is normal.

* Q3.2. Half of the students showed incomplete solutions without using backward/forward substitution or the induction method.

* Q3.5. $A$ has to be both upper and lower triangular due to part (ii) and orthogonality, meaning $A$ must be diagonal.

* Q10.3. Use the fact that eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent.

## Today

* SVD (cont'd).

* MV calculus and optimization.
