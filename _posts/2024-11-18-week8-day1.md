## Announcement

* HW6 due Tue Nov 26 @ 11:59pm on Gradescope/BruinLearn.

* HW7 due Tue Dec 3 @ 11:59pm on Gradescope/BruinLearn.

## Feedback on HW5 (thanks to Tomoki)

* Q1.4 Some students forgot showing conditions 3 and 4 of MP inverse.

* Q2.3, Q2.4. I might be strict, but many did not check the vector given as $b$ is the same length as $a$, which is necessary.

* Q2.5: Everyone made it as a solution, but it would be better for you to explain what’s exactly happening in each step: $H_1 A$, $H_2 H_1 A$, ...

* Q3: A few students did not follow your lecture or Slack and used (A’A)^- (A’A) = I (identity), which is incorrect.

## Today

* Positive definite matrices.

* SVD.
