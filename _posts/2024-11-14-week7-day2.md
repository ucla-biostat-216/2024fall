## Q&A

* Q3.2. Hint: In class, we [showed](https://ucla-biostat-216.github.io/2024fall/slides/07-matinv/07-matinv.html#how-to-characterize-all-solutions-to-mathbfa-mathbfx-mathbfb) that $N(A) = C(I- A^- A)$.

* Q3.3. Hint: [lecture](https://ucla-biostat-216.github.io/2024fall/slides/08-ls/08-ls.html#least-squares-solution).

* Q2 (Householder algorithm) context. This is what's happening when you call `lm` (`qr`) in R!

* Q4. You can use whatever computer language (R, Python, Julia, etc.) you like for this question.
