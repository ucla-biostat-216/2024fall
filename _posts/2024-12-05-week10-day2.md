## Announcement

* Course evaluation: [MyUCLA](https://my.ucla.edu/).

## Feedback on HW7

* See Tomoki's feedback on Slack.

## Q&A

* Summary of matrix decompositions: LU, Cholesky, QR, spectral decomposition, SVD. When to use what? 

* HW5 Q2.6, HW6 Q3.5.

* [SVD exercises](https://ucla-biostat-216.github.io/2024fall/slides/12-svd/12-svd.html#some-exercises), HW5: Q1.3, Q1.4, Q3.1,  HW7 Q3.6. BV: 12.4(c), 12.8(b).

* HW7 Q3.6

* Could you cover any quick tips and tricks of finding eigenvalues (for instance, if it's a diagonal matrix, if the columns are dependent, etc.)? I'm also a little confused on when an eigenvalue for a matrix is repeated, and was wondering if you could clarify that and what it means (such as if there's any significance to it beyond having a repeated root).

* In the eigen-decomposition lecture, why must (λI − A)x = 0, λI − A be singular and det(λI − A) = 0?

* Can eigen-decomposition be the same as the SVD, and when (for instance the first matrix of homework 7 question 4 has the same eigen-decomposition and SVD I think)?

* HW6: Q6, Q7.1, Q7.3.

## Today

* MV calculus and optimization (cont'd).
