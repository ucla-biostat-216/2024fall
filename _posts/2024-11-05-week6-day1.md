## Announcement

* Midterm on Nov 7: in class (10am-11:50am), closed book, one cheat sheet (letter size, double-sided) allowed, exam and sratch papers provided. 

* HW5 posted and due Nov 15 @ 11:59pm on Gradescope/BruinLearn.

## Q&A

- Affine function. Why? The correspondence between affine functions and $Ax + b$.

- HW2, Q1.

- HW2, Q2, positive definiteness.

- HW3, BV 10.11 a, b.

- HW3, BV 10.36 a.

- HW4, Q5.

- How does Gram-Schmidt algorithm produce QR factorization, esp, when the matrix has linearly dependent columns?

- Difference between QR factorization and rank factorization?

- Draw the four subspaces for an example $A$ and what information can we obtain from the plot?

- Show $\|\|x - y\|\| \le \|\|x - z\|\| + \|\|z - y\|\|$.

- Show $\|\|A + B\|\| \le \|\|A\|\| + \|\|B\|\|$.

- How affine function can be written in the form $Ax + b$?

- Explain: $A$ with dim $mxn$ is sparse, between nnz(A) and 2nnz(A) flops, much less than 2mn flops. What does nnz(A) stanford for?
